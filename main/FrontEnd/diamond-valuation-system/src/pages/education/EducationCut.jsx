            Cut is one of the diamond’s four primary quality markers, known as
            the 4Cs. It relates to the diamond’s proportions and technical
            details, influencing its brilliance. A superior cut offers enhanced
            fire and sparkle.

            Diamond cuts are graded from ‘Excellent’ (or ‘Ideal’) at the top to
            ‘Poor’ at the bottom. Typically, trustworthy online sellers avoid
            diamonds below ‘Good’ cut quality. Among the 4Cs, cut stands out as
            the most crucial, significantly impacting the diamond’s beauty and
            radiance.

            In August 2005 the GIA announced the introduction of a new “cut

            “The addition of a cut grade to the GIA Diamond Grading Report and
            GIA Diamond Dossier for round brilliant diamonds is the result of
            more than 15 years of research and testing, including sophisticated
            computer modeling and ray tracing of more than 38.5 million
            proportion sets.”

          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            GIA diamond cutting grades for a round brilliant cut diamond will
            range from Excellent to Poor. Diamond cut grade is based on a number
            of factors including symmetry, polish, brilliance and fire. For the
            most brilliance and beauty, only consider round brilliant cut
            diamonds with an Excellent cut. Ensure the symmetry and polish of
            the diamond are either Excellent or Very Good.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            The reality is that 55% of all round cut diamonds receive an
            excellent cut grade from the GIA. About 25-30% of these “excellent”
            cut diamonds are not recommended. Our consultants review thousands
            of Excellent cut diamonds and find bad specs (depth, table, and
            angles).
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            That’s why it’s important to look at the cut grade of a diamond on
            the GIA certificate, but to also review the diamond closely yourself
            or ask an expert. You don’t want to end up paying for an Excellent
            cut diamond that’s only mediocre.

            How to Choose the Best Diamond Cuts
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            With most of the 4 C’s of diamonds (the others being clarity, color
            and carat weight), there’s a sweet spot where beauty and value meet
            up.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            To use diamond clarity as an example, there is a point (generally
            around VS1-VS2) where any increase in grade is not going to offer a
            noticeable increase in beauty. To the naked eye, a VS1 or VS2
            diamond will likely appear clean and flawless.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            Diamond cut, however, is different. It’s the one grade you don’t
            want to compromise on. While middling grades in clarity or color can
            be concealed, and low-carat diamonds can still have a radiant and
            beautiful appearance, a low cut grade is likely to result in a
            diamond that doesn’t dazzle like it is supposed to.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText} m={"0 0 20px 0"}>
            We recommend you restrict your search to only Excellent or Ideal cut
            grades, as there is no hiding a below-average cut. Even if your
            budget forces you to sacrifice in other areas, a well-cut diamond
            should still have the potential to stand out.

            As with all areas in which diamonds are graded, the price can rise

          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            Their prices are based on the precision and quality of the
            cut—primarily its proportions and symmetry. For example,{" "}

              this diamond from Blue Nile

            is about as perfect a cut as you can get. The depth, table and all
            other proportions are as exact as can be. Because of that, you are
            paying a higher price for the diamond, even compared to a typical
            excellent cut diamond.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            If the diamond’s facets (the glossy flat surfaces of a diamond) are
            proportional, for instance, they refract and reflect light back to
            the eye in tremendous fashion. Diamonds that aren’t as precisely cut
            have facets and pavilions that do not refract and reflect light as
            spectacularly.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            The amount of light return and brilliance found in an exceptionally
            cut diamond is worth the extra price. Without brilliance and fire, a
            diamond is less than radiant—no matter the carat weight or table
            size.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            In other words, a diamond’s cut is the quality that most
            significantly impacts its beauty. That’s why the cost of diamonds
            with higher cut grades are worth every penny—and it’s better to
            spend more on cut than on diamond color or clarity.

            To further understand the factors impacting diamond cut quality,
            let’s examine a diamond’s proportions, primarily its table, width

            Diamond cut proportions directly affect a diamond’s ability to

            ratios between size, angle and shape of each diamond facet. Various
            combinations of these elements impact how the diamond will interact
            with light, which determines its overall beauty and lasting appeal
            (as well as its GIA grading). Don’t forget that different diamond
            shapes have different proportions.

            The width is most important when it comes to determining length to

            Length to width ratio is measured by dividing the length of the

            When a diamond is cut too shallow, light hits the pavilion at a low

            While shallow cut diamonds may seem largely based on their table
            size (they are also called spready diamonds), the escape of light at

            Deep Diamond Cut
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            When a diamond is cut too deep, light hits the pavilion at a sharper
            angle, causing it to immediately reflect to another pavilion. The
            light is forced to retract and pass through the bottom of the
            diamond. As this happens, light is dulled and the diamond becomes
            less vibrant and radiant.

          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            A deeply cut diamond also tends to look smaller than those of an
            ideal cut.

            What is the best Diamond Cut?
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            Simply put, a well-cut diamond maximizes the light that strikes each
            pavilion. Instead of escaping through other parts of the diamond,
            light reflects back through the crown and table. For our readers
            that are focused on cut, they have had the most success with James
            Allen’s True Hearts and Blue Nile’s Astor Cut diamonds.

            poorly cut to get the most sparkly diamond.

            Symmetrical facets
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            The facets of a diamond are the tiny mirrors that reflect light back
            to your eyes. Facets surround the diamond’s table. There are facets
            above the girdle and below the girdle. The pavilion (the part of the
            diamond below the girdle that reaches to the culet) is also made up
            of facets. Round brilliant cut diamonds have 58 facets in total.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            The size, placement and symmetry of the facets impact how well the
            diamond refracts and reflects light. A diamond with unproportioned
            facets, too many facets or fewer facets, can cause a less than ideal
            diamond.

            Brilliance
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            A diamond’s brilliance is the brightness of the white light
            reflection. When looking at a diamond face-up under light, it should
            reflect an abundance of white light. A diamond that’s not
            symmetrical, is cut too deep or too shallow, for example, looks dull
            instead of brilliant.

            Fire

          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            A diamond’s fire is the amount of colored light that reflects off of
            the table and facets. Well-cut diamonds not only have brilliance but
            fire too. When looking at the diamond face-up under light—especially
            daylight—you should see colored light bouncing off of the diamond.
            If the diamond doesn’t exhibit colored light reflection, the diamond
            has a low amount of fire.

            Scintillation of a diamond refers to the flashes of sparkle when
            light moves on the diamond’s table and facets. The scattering of
            light resembles a sparkle and is caused by the light and dark areas
            on the diamond’s surface. A diamond with a large amount of
            scintillation is more desirable. A diamond without much
            scintillation can appear dull.

            The finishing details are the craftsmanship of the diamond and
            include its permanent treatment and polishing. The polish of a
            diamond refers to the condition and quality of the facet surfaces. A
            diamond that is polished well creates a clear mirror for light to
            reflect off of. A diamond with a poor polish job looks dull because
            the facets don’t reflect light as vividly.

            Factors for Determining Diamond Cut Quality

          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            Because diamond cut is an enormous element in determining the beauty
            and brilliance of any diamond, there are some complexities. Many
            factors play a role in how a diamond’s cut quality is determined.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            The main factors impacting diamond cut quality are:

          </UnorderedList>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            When you’re looking to see how well-cut diamonds are, take note of
            how their facets and angles reflect light. Specifically, note how
            bright and sparkly the light return is when placed under a normal
            lamp.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            You’ll want to gauge diamonds’ fire (the rainbow light of
            reflection) and brilliance (colorless light and sparkle of the
            diamond). Be sure to also watch for any dark spots within the piece.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            When a diamond is poorly cut (even if it has a high color or clarity
            grade), light will not reflect as well back to your eyes, making it
            a duller, more lifeless diamond.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            Be sure to review the GIA cut grade on a diamond’s report, which
            will include ratings of Poor, Good, Very Good or Excellent.

            What’s the difference between Diamond Cut and Diamond Shape?
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            The terms diamond cut and diamond shapes have distinct meanings.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            Diamond shape describes the outline or figure of the diamond. For
            example, pear, oval and round brilliant refer to the shape
            appearance of the diamond.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={normalText}>
            Cut refers to the facets, symmetry, dimensions and reflective
            qualities of the diamond. Pear-shaped diamonds, for instance, may be
            cut shallow or deep, dull or brilliant. The heart shape remains,
            while the cut may differ significantly. The finer the cut, the
            greater the brilliance and fire of the diamond.

            For round brilliant diamonds the GIA assigns a rating of Excellent
