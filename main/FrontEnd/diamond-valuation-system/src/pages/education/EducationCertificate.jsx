            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Diamond certificates, or grading reports, are issued by accredited
              gemological laboratories, such as the Gemological Institute of
              America (GIA). The diamond certificates contain information and
              grades for each of a diamonds characteristics based on the 4Cs -{" "}

            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Along with each diamond you're considering, you should receive and
              review its lab certification. This lab report or certificate will
              be issued by a grading entity and describes various elements of
              the diamond, such as color, clarity, length and width. Trained
              professionals evaluate, scrutinize and measure the diamonds using
              professional tools, such as a loupe or microscope.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Each entity grades and describes diamonds differently—and
              sometimes the difference is significant. Several lab entities
              exist and it's important to know which ones are trustworthy and
              reliable, and which ones are not.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Because diamond certificates are not created equal, the price and
              value of diamonds are not comparable across varying
              certifications. Ensure that you purchase a diamond with a
              certificate from a highly reputable grading entity—and that you
              review the diamond closely before purchase.

            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              For example, the GIA will not grade a diamond the same way the IGI
              rates a diamond. The reliability of the color and clarity
              grades—and in some instances the cut grades—is only as good as the
              certifying lab's reputation. But if one lab consistently gives a
              single clarity grade higher than another lab, that lab is by no
              means less “authentic.”

              Diamond grading is subjective
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              All diamond grading is subjective—and contrary to popular
              belief—there is not a central organization that mathematically
              defines what a “G” color is or what an “SI1” clarity looks like.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              If one lab consistently calls one color grade “G” while another
              lab will consistently calls that same color “H”, it's perfectly
              acceptable and reasonable—as long as they do so consistently.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              It's important to note that even when an entity is consistent in
              its grading, it doesn't necessarily mean the entity is reliable
              and trustworthy. Buying a diamond with a weak certificate at a
              high price point is not prudent—even if the entity consistently
              grades diamonds this way—because you are not getting the value for
              the price you're paying.

              Every lab has its quirks. Some are looser in grading diamond
              clarity, while others are looser in rating color. Some labs will
              always upgrade specific color ranges, while others favor
              particular arrangements of inclusions.

            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              The best diamond certifications are the GIA and AGS because
              they’re the most consistent lab grading entities. That means you
              can trust their grading in all aspects like color, clarity and
              diamond cut. These labs also grade more rigorously than other
              labs. When a diamond comes with a GIA or AGS certificate, you can
              trust what the report is saying. That’s why we only recommend
              buying diamonds with GIA and AGS certificates.

              somewhere in between grades, a manufacturer or retailer may send
              the diamond to multiple laboratories looking for the better grade.
              For example, say a diamond is a weak I color or strong J color,
              and they received a J color from GIA. The wholesaler/retailer may
              try sending it to AGS for the I color (they can then sell it for
              much more money). Its far more likely that the grades will be the
              same, but its possible they will get the upgrade (which more than
              makes up for the cost of sending it to AGS for certification).

            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              It is very common for companies to use AGS for branded super ideal
              diamonds (like True Hearts, or Hearts on Fire). But AGS is not as
              commonly used for non-round diamonds. So if a retailer has 50
              cushion cut diamonds, 49 of which are GIA certified and one AGS
              diamond, that diamond is likely to have received an upgrade.

              This is not a knock on AGS, merely an observation of how some
              wholesalers and retailers may try to take advantage of the end
              consumer. All in all, AGS is a very reliable laboratory. We only

              GIA has a reputation for rating rated Color and Clarity, the most
              subjective scales, more rigorously. Because of GIA’s high
              reputation, proven consistency and history, we recommend only
              buying diamonds with a GIA or AGS certificate. Now, GIA even
              certifies lab-grown diamonds. ={" "}

            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              The IGI (International Gemological Institute) began as the blue
              collar workhorse of the diamond business.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              They were the most popular gem lab for major jewelry chains in the
              United States and Canada, like Kay, Zales and others.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              IGI is like a factory: they work fast, and their prices are much
              better than those of GIA—which appeals to diamonds sellers but not
              necessarily the end consumer.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              While IGI bills itself as a top-of-the-line laboratory, this is
              unfortunately not the case. From extensive experience in the
              diamond industry, we have continually seen that their grading is
              lax and less consistent than the standard bearers in the industry,
              like GIA.

            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              The EGL (European Gemological Laboratory)—vastly and
              inconsistently—inflates their quality claims. When considering an
              EGL certified diamond, you may think you’re getting a better deal.
              In reality, the price is highly inflated for an inferior product.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              We unfortunately have seen many customers purchase an EGL
              certified diamond thinking they found a great deal, only to
              realize they fell for a selling trick
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              As an example of one of these selling tricks, we found an EGL
              certified 1.00 Carat H VS1 ideal cut online for $4,450. At first,
              it seems like an incredible deal. In reality, though, when EGL
              claims it's an H VS1, 50% of the time it's actually a J SI1—and
              50% of the time it's a J SI2 or K SI1: not an H VS1.

              Searching for a GIA certified diamond two or three Color grades
              lower or one or two Clarity grades lower will ensure you purchase
              a higher quality diamond for a cheaper price.

              </strong>{" "}
              No matter how “cheap” it seems to you compared to GIA certified
              diamonds, it's all a game.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Any EGL certified stone in the market is, by definition, more
              expensive than its identical self as certified by the GIA.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              As evidence, we sent in the same four diamonds to EGL to receive
              Color and Clarity gradings — the most subjective scales.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              It's evident that the EGL graded the diamonds higher than the
              other labs. An EGL graded diamond with a Clarity of VS2, for
              example, it is not comparable to a VS2 given by the GIA. For this
              reason, the price and value of a EGL diamond is incomparable and
              inequivalent to a diamond certified by GIA.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              In addition, the two EGL labs that graded these diamonds offered
              different results. The inconsistency among the labs makes it
              difficult to trust the grading and verify the actual quality and
              value of an EGL diamond.

              5. HRD Certification
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              HRD (Hoge Raad voor Diamant) is a diamond grading organization
              based in Europe. Not generally regarded as a legitimate
              alternative in the United States, HRD still claims to be the
              authority for diamond grading in the world.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Over the years, we have experienced incredible inconsistency with
              HRD grading. They usually average about two Color and/or Clarity
              grades above the GIA’s grading. HRD graded diamonds are usually
              priced much higher than equivalent diamonds graded by the GIA.
              This allows for significant profits to be made by diamond
              companies.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              To offer a comparison between HRD grading and other labs, we sent
              four stones to various lab entities. In the chart below, you can
              see HRD graded the same four diamonds better than the GIA in the
              categories of Color and Clarity: two highly subjective grades.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              The clear difference between the grading demonstrates that it's
              not prudent to compare apples to apples among lab entities. Simply
              put, an F Color grading given by HRD will not mean the same as a
              GIA F Color diamond. The price you'll pay for an HRD diamond will
              not compare to the value and quality of a GIA graded diamond—even
              if it's a grade or two higher
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              <strong>
                If you are considering an HRD certified diamond, we suggest
                reconsidering
              </strong>
              . We recommend only purchasing diamonds that come with a GIA or
              AGS certificate.

            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              The GSI (Gemological Science International) is a new grading
              entity that's only been around for a few years. Unfortunately they
              didn't come to the industry with fresh ideas or innovative
              technology.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              We have found that GSI grading is not only looser than the gold
              standards (GIA and AGSL labs), but weaker than than the next level
              down (IGI and HRD) as well. GSI also doesn't maintain consistent
              gradings, to try, for example, adjusting the grades down 1 or 2
              qualities and calculating the value.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              For these reasons, we do not recommend buying a diamond that has a
              GSI certificate.{" "}
              <strong>
                We strongly encourage only buying diamonds that have a GIA or
                AGS certificate.
              </strong>{" "}
              By doing so, you actually know what you're getting and you can
              compare apples to apples. Retailers don't use inaccurate
              certificates like GSI in order to give the consumer a better deal;
              they do it to make more money off of those consumers.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              To demonstrate how GSI grades diamonds compared to other labs, we
              sent four stones to GSI, IGI, HRD, EGL and GIA. For the Color and
              Clarity grades—the two most subjective categories—we received
              distinctly different results.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              GSI graded some of the diamonds higher than the GIA and some
              lower, making it hard to determine the consistency of a GSI
              grading. When looking for a diamond, it’s critical to chose a
              diamond certified by a reliable, consistent entity, like the GIA,
              so you know that what you are buying matches the actual value of
              the stone.
