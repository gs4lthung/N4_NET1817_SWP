              Carat, one a diamond's 4cs, describes the weight, not the size of
              a diamond. Diamond carats have a weight equivalent of 0.20 grams.
              So a one-carat diamond is 0.20 grams, and a five-carat diamond is
              one gram. The carat weight plays no role in determining the beauty
              and sparkle of a diamond.

              A diamond size chart can help you determine what might be the

              The diamond carat size chart is meant to be a reference point, as

              In the diamond size chart below, we display the diamond’s diameter

              What is a Diamond Carat Size?
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              According to Wikipedia, the term diamond carat comes from the
              Greek word meaning “fruit of the carob tree.”
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              But you should understand that carat is actually a measurement of
              weight, not size.{" "}
              <strong>
                One carat is equal to 0.2 grams, or 200 milligrams.
              </strong>{" "}
              So diamond carat size is something of a misnomer, as a diamond's
              carat doesn't tell you exactly how big or small it is - though
              there is a correlation. As{" "}

              , the worlds leading diamond grading lab, says “carat weight seems
              like a straightforward measurement, but there is more to it than a
              simple number”.
            </Text>

            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              In ancient times, the seeds of the carob pod were used as
              standards for weight measurements, since the size of their seeds
              were almost always identical. This provided a natural standard of
              measurement.

            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              In 1907 at the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures,
              it was agreed that a modern diamond carat should equal precisely
              200 milligrams. This is technically known as a metric carat, and
              is the standard diamond carat weight that is used universally
              today.

              Why Does Diamond Carat Size Matter?
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              The truth is, it doesn’t matter. Think about it. When you look at
              a diamond set in a ring, what does your eye see? Does your eye see
              weight, or does your eye see physical size? Obviously, your eye
              can only see physical dimensions—light doesn’t carry weight
              information back to your eye.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              And if you think about it even more, your eye also doesn’t see the
              total physical size of the diamond, because most of it will be
              covered in jewelry. All you can really see when you look at a
              diamond is the size of its surface area on the top of the diamond,
              as displayed above in our diamond carat size chart.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              However, carat weight is important when it comes to the diamond
              price. And where do you find the actual diamond carat weight?

              Even though this article is about carat size, eye-cleanliness is

              clarity; other factors matter as well) “eye-clean” diamond you can
              find. We use “eye-clean” to describe diamonds that may have
              inclusions if you look at them with a magnifying glass (or
              microscope or loupe), but the typical person can’t see the

              Carat and Diameter Correlation
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              Now, obviously, there is a direct correlation between the diamond
              carat weight and the diameter of a diamond. It’s mathematically
              impossible for a 0.05ct diamond to have more surface area than a 1
              carat diamond.

            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              But because cut qualities can vary greatly, there is a vast amount
              of variance in the range of possible diameters for any given carat
              weight.

              In my experience at Leo Schachter, a 1 carat diamond ring can have
              a diameter that ranges from 5.60mm (a horrifically ugly deep
              diamond) all the way to about 6.60mm (a shallow “flat” diamond).

              Take a look at these three diamonds. They are all the same exact
              carat weight – 1.20ct.

              The <strong>first diamond</strong> is very deeply cut. You can see
              the diamond is very dark in the middle and has a diameter of
              6.73mm.

              The <strong>second diamond</strong> is very shallow and has a
              diameter of 7.03. This diamond looks glassy and won’t have much
              sparkle in natural light.

            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              The <strong>third diamond</strong> looks exactly like a round
              diamond should look. The proportions are perfect and the diamond
              will be very brilliant.

              How Big is a 1 Carat Diamond?
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              A one carat round diamond will usually have a diameter of 6.4mm,
              which comes out to approximately 1/4 of an inch.

              How Big is a Half Carat Diamond?
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              A half carat diamond is usually 5.1mm in diameter. That is 1/5th
              of an inch. To compare that, a one carat diamond is 6.4mm. So
              while the one carat is double the weight, the face of the half
              carat diamond is only 21% smaller.

              And how much does it weight? It weighs exactly half of a one carat
              diamond. Half carat diamonds are also referred to as ½ carat
              diamonds, .5 diamonds, 0.5ct diamonds, or 50 point diamonds.

              Examples of beautiful half carat diamonds include this round
              brilliant from James Allen and this cushion cut diamond from Blue
              Nile. See our diamond size chart above for mm to carat for a half
              carat diamond.

              Do Lab Diamonds Weight the Same As Natural Diamonds?
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              Yes, lab-grown diamonds weigh the same, and are measured the same
              in terms of weight, as natural or Earth-grown diamonds.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              Lab diamonds are exactly the same, chemically and physically, as
              diamonds formed naturally in the Earth. They are graded the same
              way as well, across the 4 C’s, which includes carat weight.

            <Text fontSize={{ base: "sm", md: "md", lg: "lg" }}>
              That means everything in this article, such as how carat weight
              translated to actual carat size, applies to diamond sizes for both
              lab-grown and natural diamonds.

              So as you can see, while weight, as one of the 4 C’s of diamonds,
              should matter to you because it will help determine how much you
              are going to pay, what you should really be focusing on is the
              diamond cut and diameter.
